I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the Department of Information Engineering of the **University of Padova**, Italy, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabio Vandin](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/PI.html).
I am part of the [AIDA Lab](https://aidalabdei.github.io/) and of the [DSH Lab](https://dsh.fbk.eu/) at **Fondazione Bruno Kessler**.

Research Interests
======
My research interests primarly involve algorithms for **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**, both from a theoretical point of view and from a more applicative perspective, with a particular focus on **Biomedical data**.
With the AIDA lab I am working on efficient and scalable approximation algorithms with guarantees to solve data mining problems on complex data structures such as graphs.
As part of the DSH group, instead, I am applying cutting-edge **Deep Learning** architectures on real biomedical data, often multimodal, to deal with practical tasks.
